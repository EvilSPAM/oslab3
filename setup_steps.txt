//I started setting up with latest LTS 16.04 but there were some bugs and instructions needed some changes.
// I wanted to shift to 13.10 because this is what they have used it in their experiment but 13.10 is already end of Life. Hence I used Ubuntu 14.04(LTS) over VirtualBox for this setup.

Move to android sdk directory and move to tools directory
run android with avd argument like "android avd"
In my case sd card size wasn't there I made it 20 and API level was 15 changed it to 20
Restarted script. WOrked :)

//somehow it wasn't killing the emulator while ending the script I myself killed the emulator from other process.

./start_android.sh
