PAIN:
The PAIN paper proposes that FI experiments can be sped up greatly through parallelising the different experiments.
It further raises the questions, what impact parallelisation has on experiment throughput, as well as result accuracy. 
The paper also investigates, whether or not the parallelization can be tuned to achieve both an increase in throughput, as well as avoiding result inaccuracy.
Result accuracy is related to both degree of parallelizations and choice of timeout values. Guidelines are provided for fine tuning to achieve the best results.

GRINDER:
The GRINDER paper introduces the GRINDER tool. GRINDER is an open-source generalist FI tool, designed to be capable of different FI techniques, even those unforeseen by their authors.
The tool uses a unique infrastructure that allows a high level of code reuse, ranging between 54.5% and 72%.
